### What is YoulikeTwit?
[**YoulikeTwit**](https://github.com/RozhakXD/YoulikeTwit) is a script that is used to get free followers on a Twitter account, this script uses the feature of following each other among users and you are required to have coins so you can exchange them for followers.

### Termux command?
First you must have the [Termux](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_118.apk) application to run this script and for how to use it can be seen on [**Youtube**](https://youtube.com/rozhakid). Then you enter some basic commands below!
```
$ apt update -y && apt upgrade -y
$ pkg install git python-pip
$ git clone https://github.com/RozhakXD/YoulikeTwit
$ cd "YoulikeTwit"
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python Run.py
```

```
$ cd "$HOME/YoulikeTwit" && git pul
$ python Run.py
```

### How long will it take followers to arrive?
This script takes 1 to 3 days for all followers to log in, this process can take longer if the number of users on the website decreases. 

### Requirements for logging in?

- Make sure the Twitter account username is correct.
- Twitter account should not be locked or private.

### What if the account is blocked?

- Don't use the account you just created, if you want to keep using it, you can wait 1-3 days.
- Use a delay of more than 60 seconds.
- Make sure the account is equipped with two-factor authentication, email, and phone number.
- Don't do too much follow missions, it's best to rest for 1 hour before doing another mission.

### Didn't get coins?

**Reason :**
- There is a problem on the Youlikehits website when getting coins.
- There are few or no missions on the Youlikehits website.
- The target account being followed is unavailable or has been banned.
- Your twitter account is blocked so you can't get coins.

### Failed to add Twitter account?

- Your Twitter account is locked so you can't add Twitter accounts.
- Your Twitter account is blocked or deactivated.
- I think you have added a Twitter account to another Youlikehits account, you should check and delete the account.
